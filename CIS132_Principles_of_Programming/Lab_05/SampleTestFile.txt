 No more rhyming now, and I mean it.
 Anybody want a peanut?
 HAVE FUN STORMING THE CASTLE.
 You are in the Pit Of Despair.
 SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW, WAY UP HIGH
 THERE's a LAND THAT I HEARD OF
 ONCE IN A lullaby.
 When in the Course of human events
 it becomes NECESSARY for one people
 to DISSOLVE the political bands which have connected them
 with another and to ASSUME among the powers of the earth,
 the separate and EQUAL station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them,
 a decent respect to the OPINIONS of MANKIND requires that
 they should declare
 the causes which impel
 them to the SEPARATION.
